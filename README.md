Solving the Winner Determaniation Problem using Genetic Algorithm


Overview :

The winner determination problem (WDP) in combinatorial auctions is presented by a set of objects 
is submitted for sale to several buyers, each buyer, for reasons of complementarity between the objects,
wants to buy a subset of objects specific to it, and for which it provides an estimate. 
Conflicts between buyers arise from possible intersections between subsets. 
The seller must then solve an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem to make the sale that will bring him the most profit.

For solving this problem we'll be using the Genetic Algorithm GA.


Data :

The benchmark used are composed of 1500 offers and 1500 objects.


GUI :

The GUI is developed using PyQt5, the coresponding files will be found at "GUI" folder.
